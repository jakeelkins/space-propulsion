# space-propulsion
place to put my space propulsion matlab files from AEM528


- LRPS sizes a liquid rocket propulsion system
- cold_gas_thruster calculates time to empty of a CGT
- final report is my paper on the Russian RD-180, simulation, and comparison to the BE-4. matlab code for rocket equation is accompanied
- RL10_rocket_nozzle analyzes the RL10 rocket nozzle under different flow types
- SRPS sizes a solid rocket propulsion system under design constraints
- pipe heat transfer solves the compressible flow for a pipe at certain pressures, molar masses, and diameters
- chem_equil_analysis does CEA for a given common rocket fuels given a flame temp. solves system of equations for a mixture
- rocket vertical/angled does diff eq for basic rocket equations of motion with drag
